# Cipherwill Client

The **Open Source Cipherwill Web Client** is a user-friendly, secure interface for managing digital assets and creating digital wills. This web application allows individuals to organize their digital and physical information, encrypt it, and assign beneficiaries for seamless transfer upon their passing.

## Key Features
- **Open Source**: Open source development with full transparency and community feedback.

- **Double-Layer Encryption for Maximum Security**: Cipherwill uses a unique two-step encryption process. Your data is encrypted with a time capsule key and then re-encrypted with your beneficiary's public key. This ensures that only the rightful beneficiary can decrypt and access the information, even Cipherwill cannot access your data.

- **Proactive Beneficiary Support**: If beneficiaries face challenges accessing the data, Cipherwill’s team takes a proactive approach by reaching out to them or their trusted contacts, ensuring that the digital assets reach the intended hands without delays.

- **Digital Asset Coverage**: Cipherwill isn’t limited to just financial data. It manages and transfers a vast array of digital and physical assets, including cryptocurrency wallets, NFTs, social media accounts, legal documents, and even personal directives like health wishes or final messages.

- **Time Capsule for Legacy Planning**: Cipherwill offers a unique time capsule feature that securely locks your data until a predefined time or event. This lets you plan messages, instructions, or gifts for loved ones, ensuring your legacy remains impactful and timely.
