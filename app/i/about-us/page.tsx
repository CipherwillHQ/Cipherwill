          The Inspiration Behind Cipherwill
        </h3>
        <div>
          Cipherwill was inspired by a news story that deeply moved our founder,
          Shivam. A man had millions in digital assets, including
          cryptocurrency, domain names, and a YouTube brand. After his sudden
          passing, his loved ones couldn&apos;t access these assets, resulting
          in a significant loss.
          <br />
          <br />
          This incident highlighted the urgent need for managing digital
          legacies. Determined to prevent such losses, our team envisioned
