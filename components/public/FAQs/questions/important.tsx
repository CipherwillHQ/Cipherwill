        <br />
        <br />
        The keys provided allow your beneficiaries to unlock the data you've
        already uploaded. This ensures they can access your digital assets once
        the necessary conditions are met, based on your will's parameters and
        their relationship with you.
        <br />
        <br />
        This process is designed to respect your wishes and provide access only
        when verified, protecting your data and ensuring that it’s shared only
        at the appropriate time.

        Your beneficiaries don't need to be tech-savvy. If your data consists of
        simple texts and messages, and you haven’t added a security factor,
        they’ll be given a dedicated dashboard to access your data easily. They
        just need the email address you’ve added as a beneficiary, and they can
        retrieve everything without any technical hurdles.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your beneficiary also has security factors enabled for their account,
        they will need their own security factor to decrypt the data you've
        encrypted for them.

        <br />
        We’ve designed the system to be user-friendly, ensuring that your loved
        ones can access your legacy with ease, no matter their technical

        Even if a hacker gets into Cipherwill's backend, your data stays safe.
        That's because your info isn't stored there directly. It's kept in
        separate object storage and databases. So, breaking into the backend
        doesn't mean they can see your data.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, let's say a hacker somehow breaks into the storage or database.
        Even then, they can't read your data because it's encrypted. Your
        encryption is locked down with your own{" "}

        , making it unreadable without them.
        <br />
        <br />
        The only risk comes if you haven't enabled your security factors. If a
        hacker gets in and also manages to access the time capsule keys, your
        data could be at risk. But with security factors on, you're in the
        clear.
        <br />
        <br />
        So, the key takeaway? Always enable your security features. It's like
        adding an extra lock to keep hackers out. 💪🔐

        If you add someone as a beneficiary in Cipherwill, they'll only inherit

        Now, let's imagine this beneficiary is a super hacker and somehow
        manages to hack Cipherwill. Even then, they can only access the data
        meant for them. This would happen because they have their own security
        factor and the time capsule key tied to their inheritance.

        <br />
        However, they won't see any of the data you've uploaded for other
        beneficiaries or any other user information. So, the only risk is them
        seeing their portion early, nothing more.

      "The Shard Switch is Cipherwill's robust failsafe system to ensure uninterrupted operations, even in extreme scenarios.",
    content: (
      <div>
        The Shard Switch is a security mechanism that uses Shamir’s Secret
        Sharing, a cryptographic method that splits a secret into multiple
        parts. These parts are distributed among trusted keyholders, and a
        predefined number of these parts must be combined to reconstruct the
        original secret.

        Keyholders perform regular check-ins to confirm the system’s operational
        integrity. If they miss several check-ins or another activation trigger
        occurs, the system’s dead man’s switch engages, allowing keyholders to
        collaborate and restore critical operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        This ensures that Cipherwill’s platform remains secure and functional,
