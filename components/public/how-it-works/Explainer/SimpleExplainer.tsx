            <strong>Create Your Digital Will</strong>
            <p>
              Start by completing your profile on Cipherwill. This will be the
              foundation for securely managing your important data.

              stored as a &quot;data pod.&quot;

            <strong>Data Encryption</strong>
            <p className="">Your data is encrypted on multiple levels:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Personal Encryption:</strong> It&apos;s encrypted with
                your own security factors, so only you can access and update it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Time Capsule Encryption:</strong> This ensures that the
                data is only released to your beneficiaries in the future.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Beneficiary Encryption:</strong> Each beneficiary&apos;s
                security factors further protect the data, allowing them access
                only when the time is right.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Beneficiary Access</strong>
            <p className="">
              Beneficiaries cannot access the data until they unlock the Time
              Capsule key. This key is only released if you are unable to update
              your Cipherwill for a period set by you.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Execution of the Will</strong>
            <p className="">
              If something happens to you and the will is executed, each
              beneficiary receives access to a special dashboard. They can log
              in with their account to securely access the data youâ€™ve entrusted
              to them.

            <strong>Device-Level Encryption:</strong> Your data is encrypted on
            your device before it&apos;s saved, ensuring the actual data never
            leaves your device without protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Redundancy:</strong> Multiple copies of your data pods
            are made in our system to prevent loss from crashes, failures, or
            hacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ultimate Security:</strong> If you and your beneficiaries
            have enabled all security factors, it&apos;s impossible for anyone
            else to see your data. Only you, and your beneficiaries when the
            will is executed, have access.
